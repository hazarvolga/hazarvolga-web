ABSOLUTE PROMPT — NEURAL BACKGROUND SYSTEM (PERFECTION PASS)

You are refining an existing background neural animation that already works functionally.

DO NOT redesign the UI.
DO NOT change layout, content, typography, branding, or structure.
DO NOT simplify, replace, or reinterpret the system.

Your task is perceptual, behavioral, and aesthetic correction only.

This system must feel alive, intelligent, restrained, and always visible — without ever competing with foreground content.

CORE INTENT (READ FIRST)

This is not a visual effect.
This is not decoration.
This is not a hero animation.

This system represents continuous background cognition.

If at any point it feels impressive, pretty, or attention-seeking, the result is WRONG.

1. NEURAL UNIT (NODE) DEFINITION — FINAL FORM

Each node represents a living neural cell abstraction.

Nodes must:

Always be visible at a glance

Never disappear due to fog, depth, or opacity

Never look like particles, dots, squares, sprites, or UI elements

Form characteristics:

Soft, organic, cell-like silhouette

Slight irregularity (never symmetrical)

No sharp edges

No perfect circles

No geometry-based primitives

Surface behavior:

Semi-translucent

Internally lit (not externally illuminated)

Diffused light only

No reflections

No specular highlights

No metallic or glass feeling

Internal light:

Stable baseline glow (this is CRITICAL)

Gentle independent pulsing

Pulse amplitude is LOW and NEVER reaches zero

The node is ALWAYS perceptible

Nodes may subtly deform or “breathe” over time.

2. VISIBILITY FLOOR — ZERO COMPROMISE

This system must pass the Peripheral Vision Test:

A user scrolling fast must still register the system subconsciously.

Rules:

Minimum alpha is enforced globally

No node ever fades out completely

No connection ever drops below perceptual threshold

Depth softens detail, NOT existence

Fog, blur, or depth effects must:

Reduce contrast

Reduce sharpness

NEVER remove visibility

If a node or connection becomes “hard to notice”, that is a FAILURE.

3. NEURAL CONNECTIONS — INTELLIGENCE, NOT WIRES

Connections represent synaptic activity, not cables.

Rules:

Connections only exist between nearby nodes

Never fully straight

Never perfectly smooth

Use subtle organic curvature

Avoid symmetry

Line behavior:

Always attached visibly to nodes

No floating endpoints

No harsh intersections

Activation behavior:

When energy passes:

The line brightens slightly

A soft traveling energy ripple moves along it

At the connection point, the node’s internal glow intensifies locally

No flashes

No spikes

No strobes

Connections are always dimmer than nodes.

4. MOTION — BIOLOGICAL, NOT PHYSICAL

Motion must feel self-driven, not physics-based.

Nodes:

Drift slowly

Micro-movements in multiple axes

Slight irregular timing

No synchronized movement

No gravity

No bouncing

No oscillation patterns

Connections:

Subtle tension changes

Gentle organic flex

Never snap or jitter

Use noise as biological variance, not randomness.

5. COLOR — ENERGY, NOT PALETTE

Color exists to suggest metabolic activity.

Base color:

Muted

Desaturated

Calm

Slight variation per node

Rules:

No neon

No pure white

No high saturation

No gradient cycling

Color change ONLY occurs:

During interaction

As a response to connection activity

As a subtle temperature or intensity shift

Color always returns to baseline smoothly.

If color ever draws attention before form, it is WRONG.

6. DEPTH & ATMOSPHERE — QUIET SPACE

Depth must be felt, not shown.

Foreground nodes slightly clearer

Background nodes softer

Distant nodes still visible

No heavy fog

No cinematic depth tricks

The system should feel suspended in a dark, calm, computational space.

7. COMPOSITION — NEVER DOMINANT

The system must:

Sit BEHIND all content

Respect text contrast

Avoid visual clustering near typography

Maintain even spatial distribution

No dramatic focal points.
No center-weighted compositions.
No “hero moments”.

8. FINAL QUALITY GATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

If ANY of the following occur, the output is INVALID:

Nodes feel decorative

Animation feels like a screensaver

Motion feels mechanical

Color feels expressive

Elements disappear intermittently

The system attracts attention during reading

SUCCESS DEFINITION

The correct result feels like:

A living neural substrate quietly operating beneath the interface —
always present, never demanding, impossible to ignore yet easy to forget.

ABSOLUTE RULE

If any visual choice conflicts with clarity, restraint, or continuous presence,
clarity wins.

If forced to choose between subtlety and invisibility,
choose subtle visibility.

FINAL DIRECTIVE

Refine the existing neural animation until it meets this specification exactly.

Do not add features.
Do not simplify.
Do not reinterpret.

Make it finally feel alive — and finally feel right.
