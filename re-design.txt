Refine and restructure the existing frontend of Hazar Volga’s personal / micro-agency website into a professional, dark, technically authoritative interface, removing all generic agency-portfolio patterns.

This site represents a freelance digital professional operating like a small technical studio, offering:

Web design & frontend development

Graphic design & visual systems

Social media management

Microsoft 365 sales & technical support

Server & infrastructure management

Software development

Brand & digital consultancy

The goal is clarity, credibility, and capability — not creativity for its own sake.

CRITICAL CORRECTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ Do NOT use:

“Project Alpha / Beta / Gamma”

Category labels like “Architecture”, “E-Commerce”, “Corporate”

Portfolio-template naming

Creative-agency jargon

Fictional or abstract project descriptors

✅ Replace with:

Service-oriented case descriptions

Outcome-focused titles

Technology-driven explanations

Example:

❌ “Project Alpha – Architecture”
✅ “Frontend System for a Multi-Service Corporate Platform (Next.js, Tailwind, R3F)”

AESTHETIC DIRECTION
Tone

Dark • Elegant • Professional • Technical • Confident
No playfulness.
No experimental art-gallery feeling.

This should feel like:

“A serious digital professional who understands both systems and design.”

COLOR & VISUAL DISCIPLINE

Near-black / deep grey base

Neutral greys for structure

Soft off-white text

One restrained accent color (used sparingly)

No neon

No loud gradients

TYPOGRAPHY

Typography must be:

Clear

Professional

Slightly distinctive, but restrained

Avoid:

Over-experimental display fonts

Decorative typography

Hierarchy must communicate:

What service this is

What problem was solved

What technology was used

3D & BACKGROUND USAGE (STRICT RULES)

If 3D is used:

ONLY as a subtle background atmosphere

Abstract but technical, not artistic

Low opacity

Very slow motion

No visual dominance

Optional: disabled on low-end devices

3D exists to add depth — never identity.

CASE STUDY STRUCTURE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Each case study must follow this format:

What was built (system / platform / solution)

What problem it solved

What technologies were used

What role you played

No storytelling fluff.
No branding language.

LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY

Structured layouts

Clear sections

No decorative clutter

No “showcase gallery” feel

More documentation-style than portfolio-style

TECHNICAL EXPECTATIONS

React / Next.js

Clean component architecture

Performance-aware

SEO-friendly

Maintainable

Return:

Updated structure

Revised section naming

Improved hierarchy

Clean, professional UI patterns

FINAL EXPECTATION

The final site should feel like:

A dark, professional, technically credible digital presence — not a creative agency portfolio.
