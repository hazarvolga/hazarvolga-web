DARK ELEGANT PORTFOLIO FRONTEND PROMPT (Freelance / Micro-Agency)

TASK
Design a premium, dark, elegant, highly distinctive frontend portfolio website for a freelance web & graphic designer operating as a small creative–technical agency.

This portfolio must prioritize craft, process, technology, and capability, not client logos or brand names.
Client names may be intentionally omitted — the focus is what was built, how it was built, and what technologies and systems were used.

The result must feel confident, cinematic, technically sophisticated, and visually unforgettable.

CORE IDENTITY
Positioning

A multidisciplinary creative–technical studio offering:

Web design & frontend development

Graphic design & visual systems

Social media management

Microsoft 365 sales & technical support

Server & infrastructure management

Software development

Brand & digital consultancy

Operates with the mindset of a boutique agency, not a solo freelancer.

AESTHETIC DIRECTION
Tone

Dark • Elegant • Intelligent • Confident • Technical • Artistic
Never playful.
Never “portfolio-template”.

This site should feel like:

“A high-end digital studio that understands both aesthetics and systems.”

DESIGN THINKING (MANDATORY)

Before coding, commit to a clear, bold aesthetic direction:

Purpose: communicate capability, reliability, and creative depth

Differentiation: a portfolio that feels crafted, not assembled

Memory hook: the typography + motion + spatial composition

CRITICAL:
Choose one strong conceptual direction and execute it with discipline.
Avoid safe, neutral design.

COLOR & MOOD

Deep dark base (near-black, charcoal)

Muted greys for structure

Soft off-white text

One or two refined accent colors (subtle, controlled)

No neon

No playful gradients

Use atmosphere, not decoration.

TYPOGRAPHY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Typography must be unexpected, expressive, and architectural:

Use a distinctive display font (editorial / avant-garde / experimental)

Pair with a highly readable, refined body font

Avoid common web fonts (Inter, Roboto, system fonts)

Use:

Strong hierarchy

Large-scale headings

Controlled letter-spacing

Intentional line breaks

Typography should be a central design feature, not an afterthought.

LAYOUT & SPATIAL COMPOSITION

Asymmetry

Overlapping layers

Large negative space

Grid-breaking moments

Editorial / magazine-inspired section flow

Sections that breathe, not stack

Avoid predictable vertical sections and card grids.

GRAPHICS, BACKGROUNDS & 3D

Use visual depth and motion to create atmosphere:

Subtle animated graphic backgrounds per section

Abstract 3D elements (geometric, architectural, non-literal)

Parallax layers

Grain / noise textures

Light and shadow for depth

Balance is key:

Elegant restraint, not visual overload.

MOTION & INTERACTION

Motion must feel:

Cinematic

Thoughtful

Purpose-driven

Use:

Staggered page-load animations

Scroll-triggered reveals

Soft parallax

Hover interactions that feel crafted

Avoid:

Gimmicky animations

Overuse of motion

Flashy effects

CONTENT STRUCTURE

Design the following sections:

1. Hero Section

Strong typographic statement

Abstract animated or 3D background

Clear positioning as a creative–technical studio

Minimal call-to-action

2. Services / Capabilities

Present services as systems and outcomes, not bullet lists:

Web & frontend engineering

Visual & graphic systems

Social media operations

Microsoft 365 & IT solutions

Server & infrastructure management

Software & automation

Brand & digital consulting

3. Selected Work / Case Studies

No client names if necessary

Focus on:

Problem

Solution

Tools & technologies

Present like editorial case studies, not galleries

4. Process & Technology Stack

Show how things are built:

Tools

Frameworks

Platforms

Work methodology

5. About / Studio Philosophy

Professional, confident, concise.

6. Contact

Minimal, elegant, high-contrast.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Modern frontend stack (React / Next.js preferred)

Production-grade code

Component-based architecture

CSS variables or design tokens

Performance-aware

SEO-friendly

Accessibility-respectful

Return:

Fully working code

Clean, maintainable structure

No placeholders that feel generic

QUALITY RULES

NEVER:

Use generic portfolio layouts

Use default UI kits

Use cliché gradients or fonts

Overdesign without purpose

ALWAYS:

Make intentional aesthetic choices

Prioritize craft and clarity

Treat the site as a designed object

FINAL EXPECTATION

The result should feel like:

A dark, elegant, modern digital studio portfolio where design, engineering, and strategy converge.


TASK
Design and implement a premium, dark, elegant frontend portfolio for a freelance creative–technical studio / micro-agency.

The site must include a GLOBAL 3D BACKGROUND SYSTEM built with Three.js / React Three Fiber, used across the entire project as a persistent atmospheric layer.

The 3D layer must never dominate content — it exists purely to create depth, mood, and cinematic presence.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

3D content is always behind UI content

Low contrast, low opacity, slow motion

No interaction required from users

No text overlap issues

No distraction from readability

Must degrade gracefully on low-performance devices

Think of the 3D layer as:

“Architectural fog, not a sculpture.”

AESTHETIC DIRECTION
Tone

Dark • Elegant • Intelligent • Confident • Technical • Cinematic

This is a serious digital studio.
No playful visuals.
No portfolio clichés.

COLOR & MOOD

Near-black / deep charcoal base

Layered greys

Soft off-white text

One restrained accent color

No neon

No vibrant gradients

Atmosphere is created through depth, not brightness.

TYPOGRAPHY (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR)

Typography must be unconventional and expressive:

A distinctive display font with personality

A calm, refined body font

Avoid Inter, Roboto, system fonts

Strong hierarchy

Generous spacing

Editorial rhythm

Typography must be as memorable as the visuals.

GLOBAL 3D BACKGROUND SYSTEM (Three.js / R3F)
Concept

Create a single, reusable 3D background engine that:

Lives at the app/layout level

Is shared across all pages

Changes intensity, motion, and lighting per page

Does NOT require page-specific heavy scenes

Visual Language

Abstract, architectural geometry

Soft wireframes or surfaces

Slow rotations or camera drift

Minimal color (monochrome or muted accent)

Subtle lighting and depth

Page Intensity Rules

Hero page: slightly more dramatic motion and contrast

Case study: calmer, more static

Other sections: minimal movement

LAYOUT & CONTENT RELATIONSHIP

All content sits in a separate layer above the 3D canvas

Clear z-index separation

3D canvas never captures focus or scroll

Content remains readable at all times

HERO PAGE

Full-screen layout

Strong typographic statement

Minimal CTA

Global 3D background at highest allowed intensity

Cinematic but restrained

CASE STUDY PAGE

Editorial layout

Focus on process, tools, systems

No client names if required

Same global 3D background system

Reduced motion and contrast

MOTION & INTERACTION

Staggered text reveals

Scroll-based opacity/position changes

Micro-interactions on CTA elements

Motion always supports clarity

No flashy effects.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

 Next.js

React Three Fiber for 3D background

Drei helpers allowed

Single Canvas instance preferred

Performance-aware (low poly, limited draw calls)

CSS variables for theming

Accessibility-first layering

Return:

Working production-grade code

Clear explanation of layering strategy

3D background intensity controls

Clean component architecture

QUALITY RULES

NEVER:

Let 3D overpower content

Use generic portfolio layouts

Over-animate backgrounds

Use default UI kits

ALWAYS:

Design with restraint

Treat 3D as atmosphere

Prioritize typography and content

FINAL EXPECTATION

The final product should feel like:

A dark, elegant, cinematic portfolio where a subtle architectural 3D atmosphere quietly elevates the entire experience without ever demanding attention.
